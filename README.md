### Hey There, I'm Ryan 👋

I'm currently in college, doing my best to keep up with the ever changing world of cybersecurity.

<!--My main focus is [WhisperNet](https://github.com/ryanq47/WhisperNet-Offensive), a C2 Framework. It's a continual work in progress, so check back in frequently for updates!-->
I'm currently working on a few projects, but [my CobaltStrike protocol extension](https://github.com/ryanq47/CS-EXTC2-ICMP) is one I'd like to highlight
