### Hey there, I'm Ryan ðŸ‘‹

I'm currently focused on building tools in the offensive security space, with an emphasis on stealth, evasion, and C2 communication techniques.

One of my recent projects is a [CobaltStrike ICMP Protocol Extension](https://github.com/ryanq47/CS-EXTC2-ICMP), which allows for External C2 over ICMP â€” designed for lightweight, low-profile communication in red team environments. It's still evolving, and I'm actively working on improvements.
