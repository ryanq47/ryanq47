### Hey There, I'm Ryan 👋

I'm currently in college, doing my best to keep up with the ever changing world of cybersecurity.

My main focus is [WhisperNet](https://github.com/ryanq47/logec-suite), a C2 Suite (with some inspiration from Cobalt Strike). It's a continual work in progress, so check back in frequently for updates!

My website: [Currently being developed by me](https://ryanq47.github.io/)
